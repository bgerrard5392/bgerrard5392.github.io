# BellyButton Diversity
"Putting the Impossible Burger to shame!!"

## Project Overview
Roza is a biological researcher tasked with discovering new bacteria that tastes like beef. For this project I'm tasked with building out an interactive dashboard that visualizes the bacterial species living in human navals to determine potential meat protein from the bacteria.

## Project Outcomes
This dashboard and these visualizations will enable her research participants and fellow researchers to access and view her findings in more detail.
